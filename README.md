##### Fairy tales land
The "Fairy tales land" map was designed to make the player feel that he is a dwarf (all trees, flowers are much taller than the player). On the map, we can find buildings that refer to many popular fairy tales such as Baba Yaga (a hut on a chicken's foot), Hansel and Gretel (a gingerbread house) and the movie "Tangled" (Rapunzel's tower). The "Sweet Path", which is a reference to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, leads to the gingerbread house.
